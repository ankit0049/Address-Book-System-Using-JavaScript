## Address Book Development Using JavaScript Started ....   

This is a **Node.js** application for managing multiple **Address Books**. Each address book can contain multiple contacts with details like name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and email. The application stores data in a **JSON file** and provides functionality to add, edit, delete, search, and validate contacts.

### Features

- **Edit Contacts**: Updates contact details based on the first and last name.  
- **Delete Contacts**: Removes a contact from an address book.  
- **Count Contacts**: Counts the total contacts in an address book.  
- **Search by City or State**: Finds contacts based on city or state using array functions.  
- **Data Persistence**: Stores and retrieves contacts from a JSON file.
